This research focuses on leveraging AI-powered predictive analytics to address food waste within supply chain management. With food waste being a major global challenge, this study explores the use of machine learning models to forecast waste, identify inefficiencies, and optimize supply chain operations. The dataset includes variables such as waste volumes, food types, and supply chain stages (e.g., production, transportation, storage). By employing predictive analytics, the research aims to develop strategies for reducing overproduction, minimizing spoilage, and enhancing inventory management. Initial findings suggest that AI-driven solutions can significantly enhance sustainability and operational efficiency in food supply chains.

Literature Review
The application of AI and machine learning (ML) in reducing food waste within supply chain management has gained increasing attention in recent years. Existing studies highlight the potential of predictive analytics to address inefficiencies across production, storage, transportation, and retail stages of the food supply chain.

AI in Food Waste Prediction: Research by Kim et al. (2018) demonstrated the use of machine learning models, such as regression and neural networks, to predict food spoilage based on storage conditions and supply chain delays. Their findings suggest that predictive models can reduce waste by optimizing storage durations and transportation schedules.

Supply Chain Optimization: Singh and Verma (2020) explored the role of AI in inventory management, emphasizing its capacity to minimize overproduction and prevent stock imbalances. Their work focused on retail chains where AI-driven sales forecasting and inventory algorithms reduced perishable food waste significantly.

Integration Challenges and Opportunities: According to Van der Veen and Lentz (2021), the integration of AI into existing supply chains faces challenges such as data heterogeneity and limited real-time data availability. However, their research highlighted that when AI systems are paired with IoT devices (e.g., temperature and humidity sensors), waste reduction improves across critical touchpoints.

Case Studies in Food Services: Studies by UNEP (2021) illustrated the application of AI in large-scale food service operations. Machine learning algorithms successfully predicted waste patterns by analyzing historical consumption data, enabling dynamic menu adjustments to reduce over-preparation.

Environmental and Economic Benefits: Recent work by Chintan India (2020) emphasized the environmental and economic advantages of AI-driven waste reduction strategies in Indian contexts. Their study showed that predictive analytics could help businesses identify cost-saving opportunities while reducing the environmental footprint of wasted food.

This body of research underscores the effectiveness of AI-powered predictive analytics in addressing food waste issues at various supply chain levels. However, gaps remain in implementing integrated, multi-sector solutions, particularly in developing countries where supply chain inefficiencies are more pronounced. Future research should focus on real-time AI applications and sector-wide collaboration for holistic waste management
